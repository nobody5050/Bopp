[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/nobody5050/bopp/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/nobody5050/bopp)

Bopp is an image sharing website for link aggregators like reddit, that doesnt have ads, tracking, or subscriptions.

## Why use Bopp?

* Unlike many other image sharing websites, bopp is open source. If you want a new feature added all you have to do is create a pull request and submit your changes. You can even self-host it if you'd like.

* Also unlike imgur, photobucket, etc, we dont limit essential features behind a paywall. Every feature you'll ever need is free to use on our website. 

* Bopp is incredibly perfomant, earning a 90 on google's lighthouse, as well as having less 5 second time to interactive even on 2g connections.

* It's self hostable. Bopp can be hosted for free using free tiers of firebase, cloudflare, and more.

## How do I contribute?

Start by cloning or forking this repository. Because the website is just a collection of html and js files, you can easily host it on github pages for testing.

After you've got the website hosted, change your firebase config to your personal project. spark plan will suffice for testing as long as you're fine with the 5gb data limit.
Make changes! (yeah seriously thats how easy it is to contribute!)
