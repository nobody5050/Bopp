## How do I contribute?

Start by cloning or forking this repository. Because the site is built on static webpage technologies you can host it while testing on github pages. 

After you've got the website hosted, change your firebase config to your personal project. blaze plan will suffice for testing as long as you're fine with the 5gb data cap.
